  <div class="about-content">
    <p>I live and work in Helsinki, Finland. I am a lawyer by education. The need for creative expression existed in me for a long time, but it was only through life experiences that I started working artistically. Painting opened a door to silence and reflection.</p>

    <h2>Artist Statement</h2>

    <p>I am interested in memory and memories. The starting point for my paintings is often a moment in time that I want to return to. I am interested in what we remember, and why. Painting allows me to explore the mystery of remembering and forgetting. I am fascinated by how experiences in the past are layered and intertwined in our minds. The passage of time can give new, surprising meanings.</p>

    <p>My working process is intuitive. An essential part is to search and discover, endlessly. I like to challenge the possibilities of materials and techniques to find my own ways of expression. My works contain elements and rhythms from nature, where light and colors are ever-changing. The places in the paintings exist only as fleeting moments and moods.</p>
